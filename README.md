## General Information
The purpose of this project was to test our knowledge based on skills learned to this point:

-JavaScript
-Prompts, confirms, alerts
-Functions
-For Loops
-Expressions

## Technologies Used
- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Javascript


## Setup

HTML/CSS and starter Script code was provided:
-ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
-New Git Hub Repo
-Read Me file
-script.js
-Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push

Once everything was setup, worked in VS Code to fully create, adjust, a password generator. Had to reference a bunch of material in MDN and W3schools in order to figure out structure :
-Went through a ton of different Var Character lines. Struggled to figure out how to get the characters to be individual vs strings
-I thought there was going to be a lot more if and else if statements. Turned out to not be so bad once I got rolling. 
-Practiced leaving in experimental code lines and commenting them out. Also included comments withing the JS to explain what was going on within the functions. This was an effort to annotate some of the thought/design process



## Project Status
Project is: _Continually being updated_. As i learn more JS, react, node etc, i will update this portfolio in an attempt to make as dynamic as possible.


## Room for Improvement
I think we can further improve this by removing the window prompts. I'm not a fan of password generators that work that way and wouldnt create like that in the real worl, however for basic understanding this is perfect.

Room for improvement:
-I need more practice with all things JS, however it hasnt been as difficult as I initially thougt. Feels like a distant cousin to VBA.
